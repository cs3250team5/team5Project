Good evening boys and girls...

Ladies, *(Mmmmm-tk-tk)* and gentlemen. Turn the lights down low and shut
your faces, as I wrap you in the cozy blanket of a story. A story as heart
warming and soft as a mother's kiss, or is it?

*Shhhhh=E2=80=A6*

Once upon a time there was a boat, now this wasn't just any boat children.
It was a ship! A ship full of friends, hundreds of friends, best friends
one and all! A veritable *friend-ship* it was=E2=80=A6 Get it? But it would=
n't be
very ladylike of me not to mention the most noteworthy friend on board,
Hatty Hattington.

Say HI to Hatty!

Hatty was like king friend of friendship kingdom, best friend to one and
all, and the walking definition of  =E2=80=9C*handsome gentlemen*!=E2=80=9D

Now one fine morning, Hatty and pals set out for a new, exciting adventure.
What fantastic wonders will they discover this time? Perhaps they'd come
across a scary ghost ship. Perhaps they'd find an island made entirely of
candy! Perhaps they'd meet a band of scary, swashbuckling pirates and join
forces to find an island made entirely of candy!


Who knew? But it didn't matter=E2=80=A6  So long as they were together, the=
re were
smiles to be had and adventures to be shared.

Now today t'was a day like any other adventure-y day, spirits were
*uncrushably* high, everyone was singing and dancing and having a jolly
time! When suddenly the ocean was all like "Surprise!" and a huge, massive
storm brewed out of nowhere!

*Whooooosh Wwohsoooh Woooshsbmlmba*

Boy, that was quick!

*Woooshlmvmhem*

And there was thunder, BOOM!

And the lightning, BOOM!

And the wind, BOO=E2=80=94*wusohsoshshushush...*

And like that, it was over...

"Is everyone okay?" said Hatty, "I don't know what I'd do if I lost even
one of you!", Hatty continued.

But the eye of the storm is very misleading children, NEVER TURN YOUR BACK
ON IT! Because the ocean was all like "*Psyche*!" and it came back even
bigger this time, twice as big!

*Wshoooshoooshooo*

As if Poseidon himself extended his hand in friendship and they spat in his
mouth!=E2=80=A6

*Wsho-shuubrbrbrbbrbljusjusjs*

Boy he was pis=E2=80=94 he was mad!

*shoo-weshooumshooo*

And the rain came down like a shower of bullets, *ahhh ahhh*!=E2=80=A6 and =
the
floorboards were buckling and creaking and breaking and pieces of their
ship were raining down like shards of broken dreams, and then Reginald
comes upstairs and he's all like, "I say gentlemen, I do believe we=E2=80=
=99re in
quite a spot of bother!" and everyone was like, "Really?! What tipped you
off genius?" and then Hatty was all like, "Hey be nice!"

*Whoosh-oosh oosh oosh!*

Huge giant waves thrashed the boat to and fro, fro and to, Carelessly
sprinkling friend after friend into the cold, unforgiving abyss of the
deep, dark ocean, everyone was screaming like, "HELP ME!"


Splash! Splash! Then there was this huge whale like, "Mwwahhhh!" made it
super scary. And I think there was a shark=E2=80=A6

*Woosh-woosh*

Yup, there he is!* Oh God!* And then Hatty was all like, "Hold onto your
butts, Land Ho!"

And then Bang! Bang-Bang! Smash! A *shipwreck*! As told by their fate books
of fate=E2=80=A6 and while it seems like the end, this is only the beginnin=
g of a
fantastic journey for the brave crew of the S.S Friend-ship.
